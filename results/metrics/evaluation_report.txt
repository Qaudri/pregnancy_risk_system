INTERPRETATION
------------------------------------------------------------
Both models achieved excellent performance on the test set.
High recall is critical for healthcare - we want to catch all high-risk cases.
Precision ensures we don't create too many false alarms.

RECOMMENDATIONS
------------------------------------------------------------
Random Forest shows slightly better overall performance.
Recommended for deployment: Random Forest

Both models are suitable for clinical decision support.
Consider using ensemble predictions for maximum reliability.
